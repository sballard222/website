It is difficult to link climate change directly to hurricanes, because there are so many factors, more research needs to be done . The slowing down near Bahamas was because a high pressure ridge propelling Dorian had weakened so dorian became relatively stagnant until another external force (large scale wind) was strong enough to push it. Now a low pressure trough over  Great Lakes has finally developed and is moving Dorian northward. The slowing down has nothing to do with climate change just weather patterns. This is also the time of year when hurricane season is most active (late August, September and October) when the water is the warmest and the weather patterns are conducive for intense hurricane development. This happens consistently year after year.  you are absolutely right more frequent king tides, higher ocean temps due to anthropogenic warming, and other climate impacts etc. are influencing hurricane development I’ve talked about it before but research is still currently being conducted which is why not that much attention has been brought to it!", "thealmostphd"], ["2019-09-03T10:15:05", "is it bad I wish you all got trapped with me by the hurricane @marynguy @notesbyniba @vishakhamallya @cynthiaanalise", "marynguyenco"], ["2019-09-03T10:14:06", "STOP MAKING ME CRY GUYZ", "marynguyenco"], ["2019-09-03T10:10:31", "@cynthiaanalise 🐶🐶🐶", "air.sea.sam"], ["2019-09-03T10:10:22", "@notesbyniba 🐱🐱🐱", "air.sea.sam"], ["2019-09-03T10:03:47", "So proud of you!!!!", "kattatedavis"], ["2019-09-03T09:50:31", "@notesbyniba I miss my hurricane partners in crime 😭😭", "air.sea.sam"], ["2019-09-03T09:38:17", "@pedroviloriah We are safe in Miami!", "air.sea.sam"], ["2019-09-03T09:38:06", "@pedroviloriah 👍🏼", "air.sea.sam"], ["2019-09-03T09:37:55", "@marynguy hehe thanks love 😘😘 I miss you so much!", "air.sea.sam"], ["2019-09-03T09:37:30", ".\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#hurricanedorian #hurricanedorian2019 #hurricane #weathergirl #weatherchannel #thebahamas #flooding #disasterrelief #redcross #disasterrecovery #satellite #nasa #nasa🚀 #spacetime #spaceexploration #saveourearth #protectourearth #discoverocean #sciencecommunication #stemgirls #steminist #womeninscience #scicomm #naturaldisaster #sciencefacts #scienceteacher #physicsfun #codemasters #ilooklikeanengineer", "air.sea.sam"], ["2019-09-03T09:28:56", "@nikalarian thank you Nika!", "air.sea.sam"], ["2019-09-03T09:28:50", "@fitgrad.andreea hahaha we actually were scared.

One an example is an imaging spectrometer that measures in the visible light part of the electromagnetic spectrum. It records all the different colors (or visible light) emitted from a object. There are also other spectrometers that measure different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation (not just visible light) such as infrared or ultraviolet, they are different components of the electromagnetic spectrum.
